## Linear time O(n)
Algorithms with linear time complexity (O(n)) have running times that are directly proportional to the size (n) of the input. Given input a and input b, where b is twice as large as a, it will take a linear algorithm 2 times as long to process b compared to a.

Some examples of linear complexity algorithms are summing the elements in an array and finding the minimum or maximum value in an array.
